> **Warning**

Support for installing packs in Fable is still being worked on.

You can pre-create packs and validate them, but acually adding them to your server will have to wait for ker0olos/fable#51
Don't worry it's 100% confirmed, we just don't think it's our prioity since people aren't fighting to make packs right now.

When using a code editor like "VS Code" and adding:

```json
"$schema": "https://fable.deno.dev/schema.json",
```

You will be able to get helpful auto-completions and validation error while writing your manifest
